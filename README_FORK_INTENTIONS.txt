ASMA Jira Assist Fork - Intentions

Purpose
- Maintain a private, internal fork of Jira Assist tailored to personal workflows.
- Build a calendar view focused on issue-registered hours instead of personal activity.
- Preserve existing reporting and worklog capabilities while adding issue-centric insights.

Non-Goals
- Public redistribution of the fork.
- Broad feature changes unrelated to issue-hour calendar workflows.
- Rewriting the entire application in the short term.

Planned Focus Areas
- Issue-hour calendar: view daily and weekly hours logged per issue.
- Worklog data consistency: ensure accurate aggregation across issues and projects.
- UI clarity: reduce clutter, keep the calendar and worklog reports aligned.

Operational Notes
- This fork follows ASMA internal standards for new work and documentation.
- Keep changes minimal, incremental, and easy to review.
